# Manchu-English_babyMT
This is my assignment for the ENGE817 STEM Research Paper.
The intention is to conduct a preliminary study on the Manchu-English NMT model.
Due to the limitations on time and computational capacity, this project fine-tuned the mBART model using a tiny self-collected Manchu-English parallel corpus.
The data source is from The Diary of a Manchu Soldier in Seventeenth-Century China by Nicola Di Cosmo, which includes the Romanized Manchu text and his English translation. The dataset is sequence-to-sequence sentence pair.
I cross-checked the romanized Manchu text with the scanned copy of the original diary written in Manchu script by Dzeng≈°eo and corrected some minor spelling mistakes as well as a few English translations.
